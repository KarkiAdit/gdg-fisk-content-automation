# Background

This project aims to develop a **lightweight, mobile-responsive** website highlighting Google Devs at Fisk's vision, projects, coding practices, and culture. The website will include the following pages/logic implementation:

1. Landing Page: Showcasing the vision, goals, and impact achieved so far.  
2. Projects Page: Featuring ongoing projects.  
3. Codelabs Page: Providing technical documentation or tutorials for contributions/creative implementation about any coding domain.  
4. Work Culture Page: Highlighting our collaborative work environment.  
5. Contact Us Page: Listing our email and key contacts.  
6. Admin Logic: [AI-Driven Content Automation System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUPGT8putpPJBRjOdjZVF5_r5mI7O5FfDZLyZ-qXils/edit?usp=sharing) using cloud monitoring APIs, webhooks, and Google Cloud functions.

Additionally, a consistent header and footer will be present on every page.

# CI/CD Practices

1. Always be at the dev branch while coding.

| git checkout dev |
| :---- |

2. All changes must be reviewed before merging. The repository will have two branches: **master** (or main) and **dev**. Developers should push all changes to the dev branch first. Once the changes are reviewed (mostly by PM but anyone from the team can do it) and approved, the reviewer must merge or push them to the master (or main) branch. (\*Remember to pull both branches first to sync to the codebase.)

Code change

| git pull origin dev
                     git add .
                              git commit \-m "Added feature X to improve functionality Y"
                                                                                         git checkout dev
                                                                                                         git push origin dev |
| :---- |

Code Review

| git pull origin dev && git pull origin master
                                               git checkout master
                                                                  git merge dev
                                                                               git push origin master |
| :---- |

3. Deployment will begin once the homepage is complete, using Netlify to auto-deploy changes from **google-devs-fisk/master**. As other pages may still be in progress, **dev \-\> master** merges must be handled carefully, especially after a month. Pushes to dev should now be production-ready, replacing any earlier experimental or test code.   
   Developers can try prod deployment by Netlify (\*donâ€™t forget the prod flag).

| netlify login
               netlify deploy \--prod |

# UI Design

## Implementation

Create a Prism-style dark theme using **NextUI** components. Customize the mobile responsiveness using **Tailwind** classes. Any additional third-party styling/component library can be used to better the designs. **Builder.io** can be used as a smart reference to generate code from Figma design (\*everything should be consistent). Watch this [tutorial](https://cdn.builder.io/o/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fba1319251a5848f9817b2f6d6e45ec81%2Fcompressed?apiKey=YJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt&token=ba1319251a5848f9817b2f6d6e45ec81&alt=media&optimized=true). Always use the [builder-mock-components](#file-structure) folder to store builder.io-generated content.

## Consistent Themes

### Page Theme

The design will feature a dark theme with glass morphic sections, incorporating color theory to ensure optimal contrast and readability for text and images.

### Page color

Dark bluish-black color (\#100425). 

### Font Family

**FigTree** (Bold, Medium, Regular), Use bold and extra bold interchangeably as needed.

## The Figma Mock

This is the completed [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/proto/sbbpFoBkWBA02VN8Xv3fif/GDG-UI-Design?node-id=1-255&p=f&t=9i3rhvRKZS9VfgLy-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1) for the website.

# Frontend Development

## Project Repo

This is the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google-devs-fisk/google-devs-fisk) for the Frontend logic (\*see dev branch, master may be behind).

## Project Setup

The [following steps](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1zZigCvfnV_qBMIO3y69ShcxoY921ahwtRLFHgFlmz2E/edit) have already been completed. To set up the project locally, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub project locally

| git clone https://github.com/google-devs-fisk/google-devs-fisk-website.git 
                                                                             cd google-devs-fisk-website |
| :---- |

2. Install all the dependencies

| npm install |
| :---- |

   

3. Refactor anytime for any dependency-related errors:

| rm \-rf node\_modules package-lock.json .next
                                               npm cache clean \--force
                                                                       npm install |
| :---- |


## Implementation

Next.js with the [App Router](https://medium.com/@kulsumansari4/next-js-app-router-routing-8d795dbe324c) uses file-based routing. All pages should be implemented by creating new folders (\*meaning routes) inside the [app](#file-structure). Add a [layout.tsx](https://github.com/KarkiAdit/your-next-tech/blob/master/src/app/layout.tsx) file where necessary to define shared layouts for the routes. Use a [loading skeleton](https://github.com/KarkiAdit/your-next-tech/blob/c58af730e9f83f1ba3aab5e948a2a02c90c8d8b4/src/app/page.tsx#L13) for a specific component fetching your page's data. 

All pages and their components must be **mobile-responsive** and **dynamic**. Builder.io generated components should be put in builder-mock-components and can be used as reference while coding (\*will not be used for prod.) Any reusable component can be added inside components. Any framer animation can be added inside animations and implemented using React Hooks in the hooks folder. Any data/component state props can be declared in types. Any page URL can be accessed from paths.ts. The Firestore client can be accessed from [db.](https://github.com/google-devs-fisk/google-devs-fisk/blob/ba116399d66f2ab0b9a890d05bed8d034aaad32a/src/actions/subscriberFormSubmit.tsx#L8)

## Data Engineering {#data-engineering}

We will implement [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) to engineer data fetching. Data fetching will occur within [actions](#file-structure) and be passed as props to the server-side rendered component. This approach enhances performance and user experience by combining static generation with dynamic content updates.

We will establish a reasonable revalidating timeframe for ISR components to prevent stale data while minimizing unnecessary revalidations. Incorporating **lastModifiedTime** with our revalidate logic allows us to intelligently determine when to refresh data. This approach ensures users receive up-to-date information while optimizing server load and minimizing unnecessary requests.

This is a [sample implementation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/171zelLSI20BzxAOUzkymEF-KMyIfEOvHPl2E6dFhWvM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Response Definition

Refer [types folder](#file-structure) to find backend response types.
